JavaScript Exercise: Finding the Product and the Sign of Three Numbers

This exercise is done in two ways. The first method involves finding the product of three numbers from an array that already contains values and determining the sign of that product. 
The second method asks the user to input their desired numbers, and then calculates the product of those three numbers and determines the sign of the product based on the user input.
